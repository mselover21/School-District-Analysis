# School_District_Analysis_Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to familiarze myself with the pyhton language to conduct an analysis of a school district. It was found that there was evidence of academic dishonesty within the data sets that were provided. I was tasked with several things to append the analysis to get the results without the inaccurate scores.
1. Use Jupyter Notebook to write the code.
2. Replace the reading and math scores of 9th grade students from Thomas High School with NaN.
3. Use the loc method to replace the scores
4. Complete an analysis with the updated values. 
5. Write a summary of the analysis and how the data was affected.

### Results
